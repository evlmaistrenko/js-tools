# Internationalization

The package exports an instance of `i18next`, which can be customized using the full `i18next` API. This allows you to configure translations and other internationalization features according to your application's requirements.

## Typescript

Types could be customized by creating file i18n.d.ts in your project:

```typescript
import "i18next";

import { i18nResources } from "./resources";

declare module "i18next" {
  interface CustomTypeOptions {
    resources: (typeof yourCustomResources)["en-US"];
  }
}
```
